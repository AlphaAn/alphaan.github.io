[Tradeoff relations between accessible information and guessing probability for quantum dichotomies](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We provided a closed-form characterization of binary conditional probability distributions where mutual information is a monotone in guessing probability, disproving previous claims about their monotonicity.
- We characterized all Von Neumann measurements that generate extremal probability distributions for any given qubit dichotomy, refining <a href="https://www.quantumlah.org/media/thesis/NCQT_AndreasKeil_PhDthesis.pdf">Keil’s conjecture</a> on the measurement that attains accessible information.
