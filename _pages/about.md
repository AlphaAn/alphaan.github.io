    <ul>
      <li> We revisit Shor’s conjecture on the accessible information of binary quantum ensembles and show that accessible information is not monotone in guessing probability.</li>
      <li> We introduce a state-dependent notion of extremality for quantum measurements and characterize extremal measurements for qubit dichotomies, tightening existing bounds on accessible information.</li>
